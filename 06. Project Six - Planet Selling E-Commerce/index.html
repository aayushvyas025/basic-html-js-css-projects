          Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar
          System. It is a rocky planet with a trace atmosphere and a surface
          gravity slightly higher than that of Mars. The surface of Mercury is
          similar to Earth's Moon, being heavily cratered, with an expansive
          rupes system generated from thrust faults, and bright ray systems,
          formed by ejecta. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter
          of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third the diameter of the
    
          planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Being the most inferior orbiting
           
          planet, it always appears close to the sun in Earth's sky, either as a
          "morning star" or an "evening star". It is the planet with the highest
          delta-v required for travel from Earth, as well as to and from the
          other planets in the Solar System.
